** Common Configs
	** Analysis period 52 weeks
	** Sample data is ok (customer sample)
	** Market: TUK
	** Category Shampoo only
** Deliverables
	#1 Product table (all columns)
	#2 Product Summary table: ID, Desc, totalsales_52, totalqty_52, totalbaskets_52, cardsales_52, cardqty_52, cardbaskets_52
	#3 Store-Date level wtd PPU and wtd PPW
	#4 Table #4
	
** Suggested Data processing stesps
	** Filter the Product table for Shampoo category products only
	** Attach sales, qty and basket data to it at total and cardholder level
	** Calculate price index by store
		** take daily transactions (card + non card) and filter it for only Shampoo products
			** calculate rPPU at every transaction line as - Sales
			** Calculate rPPW at every transaction as - Sales/ Weight
			** Aggregate at [date-store level] the following columns wtd_avg_ppu and wtd_avg_ppw
				** wtd_avg_ppu= Sum(rPPU)/sum(qty)
				** wtd_avg_ppw= Sum(rPPW)/sum(qty)
				** This is Table #3
	** Calculate price index by customer and index it
		** take daily transactions (card only) and filter it for only Shampoo products
			** record and report total net sales, qty and baskets
			** now remove customers <3 visits (baskets)
			** record and report the net sales, qty and baskets 
			** calculate rPPU at every transaction line as - Sales 
			** Calculate rPPW at every transaction as - Sales/ Weight 
			** Aggregate at [date-cust-store level] qty, rPPU, rPPW
				** Cwtd_avg_ppu= Sum(rPPU)/sum(qty)
				** Cwtd_avg_ppw= Sum(rPPW)/sum(qty)
			** Merge with Table #3 (on Table #3 DROP EVERYTHING EXCEPT STORE, DATE, wtd_avg_ppu, wtd_avg_ppw) on date-store
				** ppu= Cwtd_avg_ppu/wtd_avg_ppu* qty
				** ppw= Cwtd_avg_ppw/wtd_avg_ppw * qty
				
			** Aggregate at customer level
				** ppu_index=ppu/ sum(qty)
				** ppw_index=ppw/sum(qty)
	** Statistical treatment
		** Winsorise and standardise the ppu_index and ppw_index

		** Create PCA on treated columns std_ppw_index and std_ppw_index
		** Create PCA plots (CDF) and find inflection pt for prin1 and prin2 (see excel tab scrimp and splurge)
		** Create segments in the table (based on the inflection point) values
		** store the table #4
